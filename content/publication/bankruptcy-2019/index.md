abstract: We specify and estimate a rich model of consumption, housing demand and
  labor supply in an environment where individuals may file for bankruptcy or default
  on their mortgage. Uncertainty in the model is driven both by house price shocks
  and income shocks, while bankruptcy is governed by the basic institutional framework
  in the US as implied by chapter 7 and chapter 13. The model is estimated using micro
  data on credit reports and mortgages combined with individual level data from the
  American Community Survey. We perform several counterfactual experiments with the
  model which investigate welfare aspects of an important reform of the US consumer
  bankruptcy code implemented in 2006.
abstract_short: In a lifecycle model with housing, consumption, bankruptcy and default
  we look at the BAPCPA reform's labor supply impact.
