This is a graduate level course in Computational Economics. We cover a series of widely used computational techniques both in theory and in practice. The course relies on the [julia](https://julialang.org) language for technical computing, and we use online material from [quantecon](https://quantecon.org) extensively. Additional to this excellent material, the main value added from the course are the homeworks, which come with fully worked solutions.

## Materials

* The entire course material is on the website [Numerical Methods](https://floswald.github.io/NumericalMethods/)

### GPU computing tutorial

* Here is a tutorial on {{% staticref "html/vfi.html" "newtab" %}}GPU computing with julia{{% /staticref %}}.
