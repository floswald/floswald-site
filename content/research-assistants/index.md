I am always looking for motivated research assistants, and I was lucky to work with people who went on to other exciting opportunities after having worked for me (see below!). 

## Minimal Requirements

Here is the list of minimal requirements that you need to master in order to be able to work for me: 

0. Read [The RA Philosphy](https://web.stanford.edu/%7Egentzkow/research/CodeAndData.pdf) by Gentzkow and Shapiro
1. Unix shell: You need some basic unix at least to the level of [this](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)
2. Git: You need git knowledge at the level of [that](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)
2. R. You need solid R skills. 
    1. Work through [Hadley's Book](https://r4ds.had.co.nz) and show me your solutions to exercises where indicated:
        1. chapter 4 (no exercises)
        1. chapter 5 (all exercises)
        1. chapters 9 (no exercises)
        2. chapter 13 (all exercises)
    2. Often you need to work with spatial data. Here are a couple of resources you should look at and try to work through on your computer:
        1. [geocoding-with-r](https://www.jessesadler.com/post/geocoding-with-r/)
        2. [gis-with-r-intro](https://www.jessesadler.com/post/gis-with-r-intro/)
        3. [spatial-pipelines](http://walkerke.github.io/2016/12/spatial-pipelines/)
        4. All [sf package vignettes 1-5](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html)
    3. You need to know [`R data.table`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html).
3. Good `python` skills is an asset but not a substitute for 4.
4. `julia` skills is an asset.
