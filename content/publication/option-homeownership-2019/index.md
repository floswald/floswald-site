abstract: This paper estimates a lifecycle model of consumption, housing choice and
  migration in the presence of aggregate and regional shocks, using the Survey of
  Income and Program Participation (SIPP). The model delivers structural estimates
  of moving costs by ownership status, age and family size that complement the previous
  literature. Using the model I first show that migration elasticities vary substantially
  between renters and owners, and I estimate the consumption value of having the option
  to migrate across regions when there are regional shocks. This value is 19% of lifetime
  consumption on average, and it varies substantially with household type. (This paper
  previously circulated as Regional Shocks, Migration and Homeownership)
abstract_short: Homeownership and Migration are tightly connected. Owners have higher
  moving costs and react differently to regional shocks.
