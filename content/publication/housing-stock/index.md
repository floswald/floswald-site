abstract: Which housing characteristics are important for understanding homeownership
  rates? How are housing characteristics priced in rental and owner-occupied markets?
  What can answers to these questions tell us about economic theories of homeownership?
  Using the English Housing Survey, we estimate a selection model of property allocations
  to the owner-occupied and rental sectors. Structural characteristics and unobserved
  quality are important for selection. Location is not. Accounting for selection is
  important for rent-to-price ratio estimates and explains some puzzling correlations
  between rent-to-price ratios and homeownership rates. These patterns are consistent
  with, among others, hypotheses of rental market contracting frictions related to
  housing maintenance.
